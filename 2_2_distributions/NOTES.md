The colors for landing, launching, and death do not appear. I would like to work on formatting to input the NASA logo as a transparent with underlying text underneath it "Shuttle Launching and Landings". I would also like to input a function of "hovering" over the dot to give the mission number. 

For future use I would like to enable the hovering function to give details for the mission ie. mission details and possibly a photograph of either the astronauts or stars etc.
